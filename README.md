# Arduino_C-Programming
This repository contains embedded C programming implemented on an Arduino device for constructing a assistant robot

The assistant robot aka nursing robot contains various functions such as human motion detecting by using infra-red sensor, carbon monoxide concentration detection and alerting message sending, and heart rate detection. 
All these functions are implemneted by different sensors using embedded C programming on an Arduino board and stored in 'nuring robot.ino' file.

This robot also has four motors for controling movement and moving directions. These motors are also programmed via embeded C programming, please refer to the 'Robot1.ino' file.
